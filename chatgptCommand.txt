Iâ€™ved changed the JS file as you requested. Here is my index.html file. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Main Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="userInfo"></div>
    <button id="uncomfortableButton">Felt Uncomfortable</button>
    <div id="rockStatus">Current progress of rock hitting: 0%</div>
    <div id="jadeValue"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Add logic so every time I hit Felt Uncomfortable button on this page there is one hit added in the database.

In the database, each user should have the following data (just an example, you can create a more accurate one)

a user table

userid (unique key)

password

a user status table

userid (unique key)

current_rock_id (each rock as a unique id)

current_rock_status (the number of hits has done for the current rock)

the rock_ids of the past rocks that has been completed

a rock table

rock_id (unique key)

number of hits it requires to complete open the rock (a number)

the jade id (what user will get after completed the rock hitting)

a jade table
